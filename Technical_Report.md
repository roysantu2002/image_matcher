## Approach

The objective of this implementation is to match objects between two images (Image 1 and Image 2) based on detected features, and annotate Image 2 with labels corresponding to objects from Image 1. This was achieved through the following steps:

1. **Feature Detection**: Keypoints and descriptors are detected from both Image 1 and Image 2 using the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) detector. ORB is a robust feature extraction method that is fast and efficient for real-time applications.
   
2. **Feature Matching**: The descriptors of Image 1 and Image 2 are matched using FLANN-based matching. The ratio test is applied to filter out bad matches, improving the accuracy of the matching process.

3. **Label Assignment**: Once matches are found, labels are dynamically created based on the number of keypoints detected in Image 1. Each keypoint in Image 1 is assigned a label, and the corresponding matches in Image 2 are annotated with the appropriate label.

4. **Image Annotation**: After labeling, the code annotates Image 2 by placing the labels near the matched keypoints, and then saves and displays the result.

## Challenges

### 1. Mismatch Between Labels and Keypoints
Initially, the number of labels was mismatched with the number of keypoints detected in Image 1, causing errors. This was addressed by dynamically generating labels based on the number of keypoints detected.

### 2. Labeling with Limited Labels
In cases where there are more keypoints than labels, the labels are cycled, which ensures that all keypoints are annotated even if there are fewer labels than keypoints.

### 3. Performance Considerations
The code uses ORB and FLANN-based matching, which are efficient for real-time applications but might struggle with extremely large images or very complex scenes. Further optimization or more advanced matching techniques (such as SIFT or deep learning-based methods) could be considered for larger datasets or more demanding scenarios.

## Assumptions

- The keypoints detected in Image 1 represent distinct objects that should be labeled.
- There are enough labeled objects in Image 1 to cover the detected keypoints.
- The images being compared are of similar scale and alignment; otherwise, the feature matching may not perform as expected.

## Considerations

- The solution assumes that keypoints in Image 1 correspond to objects in Image 2. However, this may not always be the case, especially with objects that have low visual similarity.
- If the images are taken from different perspectives or have a significant scale difference, the performance of feature matching could degrade. In such cases, additional preprocessing or more advanced methods such as image registration or deep learning-based matching may be required.

## Conclusion

This approach successfully matches and annotates objects between two images based on feature detection and matching techniques. It provides a robust way to identify and label objects even when the number of objects in the two images differs. Future improvements could focus on optimizing performance and handling cases with significant visual discrepancies between images.
